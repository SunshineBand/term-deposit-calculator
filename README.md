# Take Home Code Exercise

## ðŸ§ ðŸ’­ Assumptions and Thoughts

- Assume the user enters safe input initially, if there is time we can add input sanitization.

## Problem statement and initial information

We are a company that creates banking software. Weâ€™d like you to build a very
simple term deposit calculator that takes as inputs:
Start deposit amount (e.g. $10,000)
Interest rate (e.g. 1.10%)
Investment term (e.g. 3 years)
Interest paid (monthly, quarterly, annually, at maturity)
And produces as output:
Final balance (e.g. $10,330 on the above inputs, interest paid at maturity).
You can assume that all proceeds are reinvested into the term deposit for its duration.

### Non-functional requirements

CLI is fine, although of course if you want to make a simple UI because you
think that best demonstrates your skills, please do. We wonâ€™t give points to a
beautiful UI so ask you to please spend your time on the code and not CSS if
you do decide to create a UI.

We want you to spend at most 2 hours on this as we need a conversation
starter and not a fully pro application. Refer to the guide below for what we are
looking for, and as long as your solution attempts to address each of these
points you should consider yourself done. Please donâ€™t include setup (of
computer/environment) time in the 2 hours, we all know how that can blow
out.
Any language is fine, and we recommend you choose your strongest language.
Please submit using a link to a Github repository. If this could cause issues for
you we will accept a .zip file with your code.
What are we looking for?
Usability - can we work out how to install and run it?
Testing - have you written tests and do they pass?
Functionality - does the program work as expected?
Application design - is there clear separation of concerns?
Simplicity - can we understand your code and how youâ€™ve structured it?
Feedback - how have you handled errors and let the user know?
Code fluency - how proficient are you at the technologies youâ€™ve chosen?

*HINT: There are all kinds of compound interest equations out there. The ones
that take year and month as arguments tend to be a lot more confusing than those
that just take a single time input (e.g. month OR year, not both).
